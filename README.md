# GRPC communication

this is just a simple project to understand the basics of grpc communication in microservices

## Overview

There will be 3 services

- API gateway
- Service A
- Service B

there will be communication between API SERVER and SERVICES and also there will be communication between SERVICE A to SERVICE B

As you are able to understand the go code i am not providing details of how to run this project  

hint: API server only deals with HTTP requests all other communications are by using GRPC
